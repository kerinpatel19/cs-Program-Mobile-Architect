**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
The event tracker app was designed to help users easily manage their schedules by allowing them to log in, create an account, and organize events. The app meets user needs for event management by enabling users to add, edit, delete, and view events sorted by day. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly interface for seamless schedule tracking and improved time management.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
The app included key screens such as:
1) Login and account creation screens for user authentication.
2) A home dashboard to display daily events.
3) Event management screens to add, edit, and delete events.

The UI was designed with simplicity in mind, featuring intuitive navigation and clear, accessible layouts. By prioritizing ease of use, the app ensured users could quickly interact with its features. The success of the design was reflected in how easily users could manage their schedules without unnecessary complexity.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**
I began by designing the user interface using the built-in UI builder in Android Studio, which allowed me to visually structure the app’s layout. Once the UI was in place, I started coding from the beginning of the user flow and worked sequentially towards the end.

The first step was implementing account creation and login functionality to ensure users could securely access the app. Once logged in, users were presented with a calendar view that highlighted the current day, along with a table listing the events scheduled for that day.

Next, I developed the core event management features, enabling users to add, edit, and delete events seamlessly. Finally, I integrated SMS permission notifications to enhance communication and remind users about upcoming events.

This step-by-step approach ensured each feature was fully functional before moving on to the next. These techniques, focusing on iterative development and prioritizing user flow, can be applied in future projects to create structured and efficient development processes.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**
I primarily relied on manual testing, carefully testing each function after implementing significant changes. This process involved simulating user interactions to ensure the app behaved as expected in various scenarios. Testing was crucial to identify and fix bugs early, validate the user flow, and ensure the app’s features were working seamlessly. It revealed areas where improvements were needed, such as error handling and edge cases, which ultimately contributed to a more stable and user-friendly app.

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
Initially, I planned to implement a scrollable view that would allow users to select specific days they wanted to view. However, this approach turned out to be more complex and resource-intensive than I had originally anticipated. To overcome this challenge, I found a workaround by utilizing the built-in CalendarView provided in Android Studio. This not only simplified the implementation process but also enhanced the app’s usability by providing a familiar and intuitive interface for users to navigate through days and view events.

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
I believe I significantly improved my UI design skills by creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface. The app’s design focused on ensuring users could easily navigate through features like viewing events, adding or editing them, and interacting with the calendar. This emphasis on usability demonstrated my ability to prioritize the user experience and deliver a clean, functional design.
